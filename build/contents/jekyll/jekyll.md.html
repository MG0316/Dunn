    <p>You’ll find this post in your <code>_posts</code> directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run <code>jekyll serve</code>, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.</p>
<p>To add new posts, simply add a file in the <code>_posts</code> directory that follows the convention <code>YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext</code> and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.</p>
<p>Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:</p>
<p>{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts &quot;Hi, #{name}&quot;
end
print_hi(&#39;Tom&#39;)</p>
<h1 id="-prints-hi-tom-to-stdout">=&gt; prints &#39;Hi, Tom&#39; to STDOUT.</h1>
<p>{% endhighlight %}</p>
